      <h1>Welcome to Igniters</h1>
      <p>Founded in 2021 by Joebin J S, Karthikeyan K P, Kishore Kanna H, and Manisankar K, Igniters began as a collaborative initiative to develop innovative projects for our college symposium.

      <p>Over the years, weâ€™ve grown through continuous learning and innovation, developing numerous projects and honing our skills in engineering and technology. Our passion for advancing knowledge and staying at the forefront of technological trends has driven us forward.</p> 
      <p>Today, Igniters has evolved into a platform that not only focuses on innovation but also empowers others through education. We now actively organize webinars aimed at fostering learning, sharing expertise, and connecting like-minded individuals who aspire to excel in their fields.<p>
      <p>Igniters is committed to inspiring, educating, and shaping the future of engineering and technology through collaboration and innovation.<p>
