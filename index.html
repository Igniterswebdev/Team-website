      <h1>Welcome to Igniters</h1>
      <p>Founded in 2021 by Joebin J S, Karthikeyan K P, Kishore Kanna H, and Manisankar K, Igniters began as a collaborative effort to develop projects for our college symposium. Our journey kicked off with "Uncomplicated Clap Automation," marking the inception of our teamwork.</p>

      <p>Driven by a passion for innovation, we've now launched this LinkedIn group, website, and YouTube channel to share our achievements, insights, and knowledge with like-minded individuals. Whether you're a fellow enthusiast or a professional seeking inspiration, join us as we ignite ideas and empower tomorrow through our collective expertise and experience.</p>
